VS code uses Emmet to create boiler plate code

1) React.createElement(tag type,{props},children);

Ex: React.createElement("div",{id:"divID"}, React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello World"));
O/p: This creates a <div> tag with attribute as id="divID" and it has a child tag <h1> in which is has the text "Hello World"
<div>
  <h1>
    Hello World
  </h1>
</div>

{} - Will have attributes which will be added to the tag defined.

2) ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode,options)

React will create a root for this DOM element and allow you to call functions on the root, such as render to display rendered React content.

3) render()
createRoot lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
Ex: const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

4) We can create sibling tags meaning, we can have 2 <h1> tags in same div by giving array of the children to the createElement functions

React.createElement("div",{},[
  React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello"),
  React.createElement("h1",{},"World")
])
